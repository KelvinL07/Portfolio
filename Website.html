        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> As a recent Computer Science graduate with a strong foundation in software development, I’ve had the opportunity to work on various projects that have honed my programming skills. Over the past two years, I've gained hands-on experience in both web and mobile development, with a particular focus on creating dynamic, user-friendly applications.</p>

    <h3>Core Programming Languages:</h3>
    <p>I am proficient in several programming languages, including Python, HTML/CSS, PHP, Java, C++, C#, and Ruby. These languages have allowed me to tackle diverse challenges, from building robust back-end systems to designing intuitive front-end interfaces. For instance, during my diploma program, I developed a Food Ordering Web System using PHP and MySQL, which required both front-end and back-end integration to deliver a seamless user experience.</p>

    <h3>Web Development Expertise:</h3>
    <p>My web development experience is extensive, particularly with HTML/CSS, PHP, and Python. I've built several websites, ensuring they are not only visually appealing but also highly functional and responsive. For example, during my internship at YouthsToday Sdn Bhd, I was responsible for designing and implementing front-end features using HTML/CSS, ensuring the interfaces were both user-friendly and aligned with UX best practices.</p>

    <h3>Experience with IoT and AI:</h3>
    <p>In addition to web development, I've also worked on IoT and AI projects, which have broadened my understanding of cutting-edge technologies. My final year project involved developing a Food Image AI Recognition system, where I applied machine learning algorithms using Python. I also worked on a Smart Manufacturing IoT Project, integrating IoT devices with a centralized database to enhance automation and data processing in manufacturing processes.</p>

    <h3>Database Management and Cybersecurity:</h3>
    <p>I am skilled in database management, particularly with MySQL, which I used extensively in my projects to handle data storage and retrieval efficiently. Additionally, I have a solid understanding of cybersecurity principles, having completed training in Cisco, which complements my programming skills by ensuring the systems I develop are secure.</p>

    <h3>Commitment to Continuous Learning:</h3>
    <p>I am committed to continuous learning and improvement. This is reflected in the various certifications I've obtained, including awards in SAS and Cisco training, as well as my consistent performance on the Dean’s Honor Roll. I am eager to apply and expand my technical knowledge in a professional setting, which is why I am actively seeking an internship or entry-level position where I can contribute to innovative projects while growing as a software developer.</p>
